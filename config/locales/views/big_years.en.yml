          Birds.uz is the organiser of the Big Year bird watching competition in
          Uzbekistan.
        part_2: >-
          If you are a fan of birds and travelling, the Big Year is just for
          you! The main goal of the competition is to photograph as many bird
          species as possible within Uzbekistan during one calendar year. Events
          like this have a long history and broad geography and have been held
          in many countries across the world since the 1930s. In Uzbekistan the
          Big Year was for the first time organised in 2014.
        part_3: >-
          Our aim is to inspire amateur naturalists to travel Uzbekistan in
          search of new species. The Big Year is also a very useful activity for
          a beginning birdwatcher, who can find it easier to remember new
          species in a competitive atmosphere and rely on the assistance of a
          team of specialists in identifying birds. Keep in mind that the work
          of the website is based on crowdsourcing, which means that
          participating in birds.uz we all contribute to the accumulation of
          information highly valuable for ornithologists.

          The Big Year is a type of contest where participation is more
          important than winning. There are no losers, and we promise that each
          participant will gain many bright impressions,  discover new species
          and visit places they have never been to.

          If you wish to take part in the Big Year, read the rules, log in and
          upload your discoveries onto our website.

          The Big Year will last from 1 January to 31 December %{year}. Photos
          uploaded after the calendar year is over will not be counted but will
          be included in the website's database and the user's personal list of
          species.
        part_2: New participants can join in at any time.
        part_3: >-
          Each record must be confirmed by a photograph on which the species can
          be confidently identified.
        part_4: >-
          The species is added to the participant's score only after it is
          confirmed by one of the experts from our team.
        part_5: Species bred in captivity and hybrid species are not counted.
