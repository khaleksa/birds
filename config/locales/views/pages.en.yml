      title: Birdwatching rules
      text_1: >-
        We are often asked why we love watching birds so much. In fact, we love
        wildlife in its entirety, but birdwatching is the easiest of nature
        observation activities, particularly in urban environment. Moreover,
        birds are excellent ecosystem condition indicators and information on
        their numbers and distribution can be very useful for specialists.
      text_2: Birdwatching is a widespread hobby worldwide.
      text_3: >-
        Tools essential for birdwatching are a pair of binoculars or an
        ultruzoom camera. Other helpful things include a birds field guide,
        field journal and telescope.
      principels:
        title: 'A birdwatcher’s principles:'
        p1: be careful with birds;
        p2: avoid situations that may cause danger or stress to birds;
        p3: keep away from nests and night sites;
        p4: >-
          in case you discover a breeding site for a rare and endangered
          species, please, do not make this fact public but make it known to
          ornithologists or nature conservation authorities;
        p5: keep to existing roads and paths;
        p6: >-
          in case of team birdwatching, do not make noise and do not hamper
          other birdwatchers’ work;
        p7: share your knowledge and experience with other birdwatchers;
        p8: share your observations to facilitate birds conservation.
