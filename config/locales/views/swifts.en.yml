        The Wild Birds Nursery registered by the State Committee of the Republic
        of Uzbekistan on Ecology and Environmental Protection in 2012 is engaged
        in the rehabilitation of injured birds. The nursery specialists treat
        injured wild birds, care for them and subsequently release them into the
        wild.

        The founder of the nursery voluntarily undertook to organise support to
        injured swifts and other birds after he once saw a swift on the ground
        and could not find anyone who could help him with this.

        In this connection, we would ask you to meet the following conditions
        when bringing a bird to the nursery:
      text_4: >-
        The nursery receives birds on weekdays from 9.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. at 8,
        SVT Vodiy, Tuzel, Kibray District, Tashkent Province, Uzbekistan. Be
        prepared for a straight diagnosis and forecast with respect to the bird
        you bring. The fact that you bring a bird to the nursery does not mean
        the bird will survive.

        We do not deal with mynas, magpies, pigeons, doves, crows, rooks and
        other urban species demonstrating high socialisation level, as our goal
        is to rehabilitate birds and release them into the wild, rather than
        provide an asylum. Nevertheless, we are ready to provide as much
        information as we can on feeding the abovementioned species.

      todo_title: What to do if you find a bird on the ground?
      todo_1: >-
        1. Wrap it carefully in a napkin, clean handkerchief or towel and pick
        it up.
      todo_2: >-
        2. Put it in a clean, warm, dark and, if possible, quiet place. An ideal
        choice would be any cardboard box with a towel or clean napkins spread
        on the bottom.
      todo_3_1: >-
        3. Give it some warm sweetened boiled water (1 teaspoonful of sugar/200
        g) or 5 % glucose solution, using a syringe without a needle
      todo_3_2: or a dropper
      todo_3_3: to drop the liquid into the bird's beak.
      not_todo_title: What should I not do if I find a bird on the ground?
      not_todo_1_1: Never throw the bird up into the air.
      not_todo_1_2: >-
        If you find any bird on the ground, it means that it already has damage
        incompatible with flight, or it is a chick that has fallen out of the
        nest.
      not_todo_2_1: Do not put a bird found in such a way into a cage.
      not_todo_2_2: >-
        Being in a state of shock, a wounded or frightened bird can damage
        itself not only the plumage, but also get serious injuries, trying to
        climb through the rods.
      not_todo_3_1: Do not touch the bird’s feathers if not needed.
      not_todo_3_2: >-
        All birds cover their feathers with a special protective layer that
        protects them from getting wet and breaking. Touching the bird with your
        hands, you erase it.
      not_todo_4_1: Never attempt to force the bird’s beak open or feed it.
      not_todo_4_2: >-
        Attempts to feed any bird can be fatal. The only acceptable option is to
        put in a box with a bird a small saucer with a suitable food for this
        species. Feeding should never be forced, because a broken beak is an
        inability to eat and a death sentence for a bird.
